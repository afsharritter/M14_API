# M14_API

## Overview 

In this Challenge, Leaflet.JS was used to map earthquake data on an interactive map that displays tectonic plate location information. 

## Results

The Leaflet.JS API allowed for the creation of this highly detailed map. Using GeoJSON earthquake data from the past 7 days, as provided by the United States Geological Survey. See Figure 1 for the initial state of the website.

The webpage allows the user to select either Street, Satellite, or Dark Map views, see Figures 2 and 3.

The webpage also allows users to select only Major Earthquakes (above 4.5 Magnitude), see Figure 4.

## Summary

This Leaflet.JS-powered map allows for an interactive user experience that visualizes earthquake data. The map shows that earthquakes from the past week tend to occur near tectonic plate boundaries. This aligns with the accepted scientific explanation for why earthquakes happen.
